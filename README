A collection of useful code for building simple compilers on Linux.
Keywords:[C/C++, LLVM, PEG, cmake]

Contents:
This collection contains the following:

parsergen: A parser generater written in C

kaleidoscope: LLVM tutorial code modified to use the parser created by parsergen.

grammar: Front-end code you can compile with your *.peg created parser code
         that will help you debug the grammar.

The Packrat parser (PEG) was rescued from the boneyard of the Narwhal project. 
On first glance it seems to be well written modular C code. We'll see how long 
this does the trick.

Status:
parsergen (parser generator written in C) builds and creates parsers from PEG.
kaleidoscope parses an input file and generates code matching the tutorial.
grammar does not exist.


Roadmap:
Write grammar front end  that allows exploring, debuging, and testing grammars.

Build instructions
------------------

>git clone git://github.com/hauptmech/my-lil-compiler.git
>mkdir mlc_obj
>cd mlc_obj
>cmake ../my_little_compiler
>make
>make install

-----------------
Familiarization
-----------------

Take a look at kaleidoscope. It's a mod of the llvm tutorial code to use the parser created
by parsergen instead of the internal lexer/parser. kscope.peg has the grammar. You can tweak 
it (adding legal operator characters is a good place to start) by modifying kscope.peg, making 
the parser:

>cd ../my_little_compiler/src/kaleidoscope
>vi kscope.peg
>../../../mlc_obj/bin/parsergen kscope.peg
>cd ../../../mlc_obj/src/kaleidoscope
>make
>./kaleidoscope test.ks

./bin - where binaries are dumped after building. Add to your $PATH if you don't like typing.
./lib - libraries are dumped here.
./include - include files are dumped here.
./src - 

./src/kaleidoscope - A compiler for the llvm tutorial toy language 
./src/parsergen - Packrat parser
./src/narwhal-utils - Helper code for the packrat parser

parsergen is a parser generator.

It takes in a .peg file following the format of Bryan Ford's parsing expression grammar. 
(http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/)

It outputs a _.c and _.h file, of modular and independent code that will parse a file 
written in your grammar. 

Usage: parsergen mygrammar.peg

The _.h file has the interface, which is pretty simple. Look in the other directories for 
more examples of usage.
